The dataset analysed in this assignment is acquired from the Kaggle website [1]. The main aim is to create a new dataset by cleaning and manipulating the existing dataset so that it can be accessed by others in a usable and readable format i.e., there needs to be no blank values, no repeated rows or columns, no unnecessary columns and no spelling mistakes. The dataset needs to be restored in such a way that a user can easily yield some interesting and important insights as to how many victims were injured or killed in the shootout or if the shooter had a mental illness or not or any correlations between different variables (Gender and Total victims and many more).
